		<p class="card-text"> <b> 1) Justification of your flow map design:</b> 
		My flow map shows the top 40 migration flows in Peru over a 5 year time period. The flow lines I used are curved half arrows, using line width and a diverging color scheme to display these flows, where darker green represents a higher volume of flows and dark purple a low amount of flows. I used quantile classification for the flow weight with 4 total classes, this let me display the high flow with 2 colors and low flows with 2 colors that I think make the map easier to visualize. I used these colors in contrast with the gray basemap. For the nodes they are displayed as a centroid of the cities using a gray color with a thin black outline to distinguish from the background while distracting from the flows. Because of how many flows to one location there were I had to only use the top 40 or else it would have felt way too cluttered with too much overlap. Also to help with this I used a light gray outline for the flows, with a black outline the map looked too cluttered with that large amount of flows going to one area.
		<div>
		<b> 2) Interpretation of flow patterns:</b>
		By far the place that received the most almost of flows would be ID:15 which is Lima, the capital of Peru. Some of the places that sent the most flows were other large cities including Cusco, Ayacucho and Ica. I would say the largest direction of flow is from south to north or east to west, depending where you are in the county of Peru would determine what way to go to get to Lima but it looks like maybe more flows are moving up to Lima from the south. Overall there is a very small amount of flows out of Lima, most of the smaller flows on the map are from other more nearby cities, I think all but 1 city has a flow going to Lima.
